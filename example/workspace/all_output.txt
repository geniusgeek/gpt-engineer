Core classes, functions, and methods:

1. Snake: Represents the snake in the game
   - move(): Moves the snake in the current direction
   - grow(): Increases the snake's size
   - check_collision(): Checks for collisions with walls or itself

2. Food: Represents the food in the game
   - generate(): Generates a new food item at a random location

3. GameController: Handles user input and game logic
   - handle_keypress(): Processes keyboard input to control the snake
   - update(): Updates the game state based on user input and game rules

4. SnakeView: Renders the game state on the screen
   - draw(): Draws the snake, food, and other game elements

5. main(): The entry point of the application, initializes and runs the game

Now, let's create the files for the project:

```snake.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Snake:
    body: list
    direction: str

    def move(self):
        pass

    def grow(self):
        pass

    def check_collision(self, width, height):
        pass
```

```food.py
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def generate(self):
        pass
```

```game_controller.py
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class GameController:
    def __init__(self, snake: Snake, food: Food):
        self.snake = snake
        self.food = food

    def handle_keypress(self, key):
        pass

    def update(self):
        pass
```

```snake_view.py
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class SnakeView:
    def __init__(self, snake: Snake, food: Food):
        self.snake = snake
        self.food = food

    def draw(self):
        pass
```

```main.py
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from game_controller import GameController
from snake_view import SnakeView

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now, let's create the Django project and integrate the game:

```django_project/settings.py
# Add the following line to the INSTALLED_APPS list
'app_name.apps.AppNameConfig',
```

```django_project/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

```app_name/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .snake import Snake
from .food import Food
from .game_controller import GameController
from .snake_view import SnakeView

def index(request):
    snake = Snake(body=[], direction="")
    food = Food(width=0, height=0)
    game_controller = GameController(snake, food)
    snake_view = SnakeView(snake, food)

    context = {
        'snake': snake,
        'food': food,
        'game_controller': game_controller,
        'snake_view': snake_view,
    }

    return render(request, 'app_name/index.html', context)
```

```app_name/templates/app_name/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <style>
        /* Add your elegant CSS styles here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
    <script>
        // Add JavaScript code to initialize and run the game
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now you can run the Django project locally and see the snake game in action. Note that the game logic and rendering code still need to be implemented in the respective classes and methods.
